# Repository Agent Workflow Alignment — Execution Prompt

Use this document as an executable task description for the coding agent.

## Mission

Bring this repository to full compliance with a strict AI-agent workflow model that includes:

- deterministic agent instructions,
- mandatory version bump after any tracked file change,
- build notes tracking,
- standardized commit message format with version prefix,
- explicit project documentation synchronization policy.

Perform all steps below end-to-end. Do not stop at analysis.

---

## Global Rules

1. Chat/output language for user communication: **Russian**.
2. File/code language: **English only**.
3. Keep changes minimal and targeted; do not add unrelated features.
4. If a required file already exists, update it to match the contract below.
5. If equivalent logic exists under different names/paths, either align it or replace with the contract structure.

---

## Required Files and Exact Intent

### 1) `AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Create or update with these policy blocks:

- Language policy (chat Russian, files English).
- Version format: `<major>.<minor>.<publicBuild>-y<yy>w<ww>b<weeklyBump>`.
- Mandatory bump rule after **any tracked file change**.
- Commands:
  - `npm run bump:build -- --desc "Short English summary"`
  - `npm run bump:minor -- --desc "Short English summary"`
- Optional scoped mode:
  - `npm run bump:build -- --version-only --desc "Short English summary"`
- Explain that version metadata is synchronized in `version.json` and `package.json`, notes are appended to `build-notes.md`, and minor bump generates a release changelog in `changelogs/`.
- Explain that default bump behavior stages the entire working tree; `--version-only` stages only version files and requires other files to be pre-staged.
- Commit message format requirement: `<version>: <description>`.
- Standard git workflow sequence:
  1) apply changes,
  2) run bump (auto-commit, default all files),
  3) run verification,
  4) no separate manual commit after bump.

### 2) `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Create or update with concise operational rules mirroring `AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` plus:

- “After any source change, review and update domain docs if impacted.”
- A `Key Documentation` section listing project-specific docs/modules the agent must consult.
- Development command list relevant to the repository (at minimum build/typecheck/test + bump commands).

### 3) `version.json`

Create if missing with this schema:

```json
{
  "marketing": {
    "major": 0,
    "minor": 0,
    "publicBuild": 1
  },
  "technical": {
    "year": 2026,
    "week": 10,
    "weeklyBump": 1
  },
  "currentVersion": "0.0.1-y26w10b1"
}
```

If it exists, preserve continuity and schema consistency.

### 4) `build-notes.md`

Create if missing:

```md
# Build Notes

- 0.0.1-y26w10b1 — Initial snapshot version entry.
```

Ensure future bumps append lines in format:

`- <version> — <description>`

### 5) `scripts/update-version.js`

Create or update a Node.js script that:

- Supports args:
  - `--minor` (increment marketing minor, reset public build to 0)
  - `--desc "..."` (description for notes)
  - `--version-only` (stage only version files; keep non-version scope pre-staged)
- On regular bump:
  - increments `marketing.publicBuild` by 1.
- On `--minor` bump:
  - increments `marketing.minor` by 1,
  - resets `marketing.publicBuild` to `0`,
  - creates `changelogs/v<major>.<minor>.md` from previous minor entries in `build-notes.md`.
- On week rollover:
  - updates `technical.year`/`technical.week`,
  - resets `technical.weeklyBump` to `1`.
- On same week:
  - increments `technical.weeklyBump` by `1`.
- Updates:
  - `version.json` (`marketing`, `technical`, `currentVersion`),
  - `package.json` field `version`,
  - appends to `build-notes.md`.
- Automatically stages and commits changes with message format `<version>: <description>` when git is available.
  - Default: stage all tracked/untracked changes before commit.
  - `--version-only`: stage only `version.json`, `package.json`, `build-notes.md` (other files must already be staged).
- If `--desc` omitted, tries to use last git commit message; fallback to default text.
- Prints the new version to stdout.

### 6) `package.json`

Ensure scripts exist (add if absent, preserve other scripts):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "bump:build": "node scripts/update-version.js",
    "bump:minor": "node scripts/update-version.js --minor"
  }
}
```

Do not remove existing scripts.

---

## Project Documentation Synchronization Contract

Create or update documentation policy in both instruction files:

- After code changes, check domain docs (game logic / business rules / architecture / roadmap equivalents).
- If behavior, parameters, UI, or flows changed, update docs in same task.

If repository has no such docs, create minimal placeholders:

- `docs/GAME_LOGIC.md` (or domain-equivalent name),
- `docs/TODO.md`.

Use concise, factual English content.

---

## Verification Steps (must execute)

Run what is available in this repository:

1. Version bump dry run equivalent by actually bumping once for the migration task:
   - `npm run bump:build -- --desc "Align repository with AI agent workflow"`
2. Type validation if available:
   - `npm run typecheck`
3. Tests if available:
   - `npm run test`
4. Build if available:
   - `npm run build`

If some commands are absent, skip gracefully and report which are unavailable.

---

## Completion Criteria

Task is complete only if all are true:

1. Instruction files are present and consistent.
2. Versioning files/scripts are present and wired.
3. `package.json` contains bump scripts.
4. A bump was executed successfully and propagated to all version artifacts.
5. Verification commands were run (or explicitly marked unavailable).
6. Final report includes:
   - changed files list,
   - resulting version,
   - executed checks and results,
   - any follow-up actions.

---

## Final Output Format Requirement

At the end, return a concise Russian report with sections:

- `Что сделано`
- `Какие файлы изменены`
- `Проверки`
- `Итоговая версия`
- `Риски / что осталось`

No long prose.
